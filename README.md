## During practice

Throughout the course, students will have to create an web app.  
This will also be the app necessary for them to pass the course.

The app to create will be a **todo app**.

**Note**: Before getting started with Laravel, we have some chapters related to PHP and it's ecosystem.  
Although the code on these chapters will not be used towards the final project, the students should still do exercises on these chapters, during the first week of the training.
These should include:

- **Creating a new PHP project on GitHub**
  - Using the built-in PHP server
  - Setting up SSH for their repositories
  - Using Git cli, or a GUI client like sourcetree, GitHub Desktop, etc.
- **Learning about commiting often and with meaningful messages**
  - See atomic commits
- **Creating classes, value objects**
  - Should be related to classes we'll need for the final project, like:
    - Todo
    - Project
    - User
    - Priority Level
    - Comment
- **Initializing composer on a new PHP project, adding packages and autoloading**
  - Learn about the difference on autoloading
    - PSR 4
    - Classmap
    - Files

- **Connecting to a database via PDO and doctrine/dbal**
  - See chapter 4
